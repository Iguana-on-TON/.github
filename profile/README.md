Iguana is a next-level AI analytics tool that allows you to track various trends based on user comments in Social Media.

## How does it work?
We parse Social Media (Telegram chats related to TON right now) in real-time and process the collected messages using our in-house AI. With it assistance, we extract the emotional sentiment of the messages towards a specific product.

The emotional expression in an individual comment remains a private opinion; the aggregated assessment of thousands of comments per day becomes a statistic. And with it, we can make The Open Network more open.

Also, we started working on Fear and Greed index. It's embarrassing we still can't measure the market in TON like in other popular crypto. Sure we can apply various methods (such as TVL), but they are not so rigid and can be easily manipulated. The most just and objective metric can monitored must be factual and real opinions of market's participants.

## Benefits for Businesses
Social Media analysis proves to be an effective tool for risk assessment, trend analysis, and interpretation of user feedback. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithms empowers businesses to respond promptly and make informed decisions, enhancing competitiveness and ensuring sustainable development in a dynamic market environment.

## Neural Networks
Our passion for neural networks is undeniable. Hence, we enthusiastically embraced the challenge of utilizing the most modern architectures to achieve the most accurate results. We use fine-tuned BERT for analyzing messages with respect to the Bull vs. Bear market index. To extract entities from messages, we rely on distilled BERT. For Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis, we utilize the fine-tuned Vicuna-family LLM.

## Roadmap
- More responsive and user-friendly UI
- Use more fault-tolerance architecture configurations
- Add new Social Media sources
